### Last Updated: 2023-07-21

## Doing Our Part
As Open Source maintainers, contributors, and fans, we believe that you should be able to develop without any borders. We value diversity and inclusion, and we encourage EVERYONE to participate. We strive to provide a space where you are welcome, regardless of:

-   age
-   body size
-   caste
-   citizenship
-   disability
-   education
-   ethnicity
-   familial status
-   gender expression
-   gender identity
-   genetic information
-   immigration status
-   level of experience
-   nationality
-   personal appearance
-   pregnancy
-   race
-   religion
-   sex characteristics
-   sexual orientation
-   sexual identity
-   socio-economic status
-   tribe
-   veteran status

Open Source software is the way we work. We believe that when everyone works together, we can develop the future. That's why we promise that we will interact and behave in ways that are beneficial to our community. Following these guidelines ensure that everyone is able to participate without fear of discrimination. These guidelines apply everywhere. 

## Expected Behavior
In a place where everyone works together, conflicts are expected. That's why we ask that you do the following.

1. **Be friendly**
	- We ask that you not be disrespectful for beginners or contributors, and that you use welcoming and inclusive language. We also ask that you respect peoples chosen names and pronouns.

2. **Be understanding**
	- While reading other users contributions, we ask that you be understanding. This means that you will try your best to view the user's submission in their point of view.

3.  **Be considerate**
	- While you might have your opinions, we ask that you consider the other suggestion, and we ask that you be kind while doing so.

## What's not allowed

The Caveman Devs are committed to building a safe and inclusive environment for all developers and community members. To ensure a positive experience, we have established the following guidelines that you should read.

1. **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, and leaking personal information**
	- We kindly request that you refrain from engaging in deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or leaking personal information (doxxing). It is very important to respect the privacy and well-being of other developers and community members.

2. **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist language or otherwise exclusionary language.**
	- This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, referring to someone by a name they no longer use (deadnaming), and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual's gender identity. This also includes making exclusionary "jokes". If you're unsure if a word is offensive, don't use it. Also, we advise against looking through commit histories with the intent to search for deadnames.

3. **Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment.**
	- During Caveman Linux Development, we strive to maintain a clean and inclusive environment. While we allow the usual swear word here and there (as long as it's not targeted towards anyone), we kindly ask that sexualized behavior be kept to a minimum. This includes making sexualized comments and/or sharing inappropriate jokes or imagery in any form of media related to or affiliated with Caveman Software.

4. **Violence or threats of violence.**
	- We ask that you do NOT engage in acts of violence or make threats of violence. This activity is NOT tolerated offline, online, and on official Caveman Development discussion boards. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to self-harm, or making bomb threats.

5. **Influencing or encouraging inappropriate behavior.** If you influence or encourage another person to violate the Code of Conduct, you may face the same consequences as if you had violated the Code of Conduct.

## Consequences

The Caveman Developer Board will serve consequences based on the weight and severity of the violation. The following consequences might happen:

- Blocked from making commits
- Banned from community interaction
- Blacklisted from Caveman Software events, or other Caveman Software related projects
- Warnings

## Reporting Incidents
You may report violations by sending an email to this address, or messaging a member of the Caveman Software Board.
