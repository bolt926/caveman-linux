# Caveman Linux Code of Conduct
### Last Updated: 2023-07-21

## Doing your Part

As an small open source project, it is important that certain standards are kept within the Caveman community to ensure the healthyness . These standards are as follows:

- Do not discriminate, profile, or harass anyone. Do not attack or harass someone based on their age, ethnicity, and nationality, and sexuality and any other traits.
- Be respectful.


## Expected Behavior
In a place where everyone works together, conflicts are expected. That's why we ask that you do the following.

1. **Be friendly**
	- We ask that you not be disrespectful for beginners or contributors, and that you use welcoming and inclusive language. We also ask that you respect peoples chosen names and pronouns.

2. **Be understanding**
	- While reading other users contributions, we ask that you be understanding. This means that you will try your best to view the user's submission in their point of view.

3.  **Be considerate**
	- While you might have your opinions, we ask that you consider the other suggestion, and we ask that you be kind while doing so.

## What's not allowed

The Caveman Devs are committed to building a safe and inclusive environment for all developers and community members. To ensure a positive experience, we have established the following guidelines that you should read.

1. **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, and leaking personal information**
	- We kindly request that you refrain from engaging in deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or leaking personal information (doxxing). It is very important to respect the privacy and well-being of other developers and community members.

2. **Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist language or otherwise exclusionary language.**
	- This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, referring to someone by a name they no longer use (deadnaming), and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual's gender identity. This also includes making exclusionary "jokes". If you're unsure if a word is offensive, don't use it. Also, we advise against looking through commit histories with the intent to search for deadnames.

3. **Unwelcome sexual attention or behavior that contributes to a sexualized environment.**
	- During Caveman Linux Development, we strive to maintain a clean and inclusive environment. While we allow the usual swear word here and there (as long as it's not targeted towards anyone), we kindly ask that sexualized behavior be kept to a minimum. This includes making sexualized comments and/or sharing inappropriate jokes or imagery in any form of media related to or affiliated with Caveman Software.

4. **Violence or threats of violence.**
	- We ask that you do NOT engage in acts of violence or make threats of violence against other members in the Caveman community. This activity is NOT tolerated offline, online, and on official Caveman Development discussion boards. 

5. **Influencing or encouraging inappropriate behavior.** If you influence or encourage another person to violate the Code of Conduct, you may face the same consequences as if you had violated the Code of Conduct.

## Consequences

The Caveman Developer Board will serve consequences based on the weight and severity of the violation. The following consequences might happen:

- Blocked from making commits
- Banned from community interaction
- Blacklisted from Caveman Software events, or other Caveman Software related projects
- Warnings

## Reporting Incidents
You may report violations by sending an email to this address, or messaging a member of the Caveman Software Board.
